## Generating tweets programmatically

This document implements a python program to generate conjoint image-based tweets programatically and at scale. The code is inspired in two main sources with similar implementation. 

- This medium post [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-twitter-screenshots-with-python-c142ef71fda7) describing how to generate tweets' screenshots in Python. 

- And Alessandro Vecchiato [implementation](https://github.com/avecchiato/Introducing_Visual_Conjoints) of visual conjoints for Twitter profiles.

This is a work in progress and part of my ongoing collaboration with Kevin Munger (Penn State), Katherine McCabe (Rutger University) and Keng-Chi Chang (UCSD). Keng-Chi Chang made invaluable contributtions to this code.

## Demos

In addition to this readme, we prepared two demos explaining how to use our functions. See below for R and Python users:

- [demo to use in R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/KengChiChang/conjoints_tweets/blob/modularize/demo-R.html)
- [demo to use in python](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/KengChiChang/conjoints_tweets/blob/modularize/demo-Python.html)

## Setup

## Calling packages

```{python}
# import packages
from matplotlib import font_manager
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
from textwrap import wrap
import os
import re
import datetime
from numpy import asarray
```

## Python function to write the tweets and quote tweets

We wrote a python function that allows researcher to create tweets and quote tweets given a set of inputs. The function has the following parameters:

- `CreateTweet()`: Create tweet using parameters.
- Parameters:
  - `author_avatar` (str): avatar of author
  - `author_name` (str): name of author
  - `author_tag` (str): twitter username/handle of author
  - `text` (str): main text of tweet
  - `reactions_retweet` (str): number of reactions of tweet
  - `reactions_quote` (str): number of quotes of tweet
  - `reactions_like` (str): number of likes of tweet
  - `time` (str/NULL/None): time of tweet in format "2022-07-05 14:34"; if None use current time
  - `quote` (TRUE/FALSE): whether or not to print quoted tweet
  - `quote_author_avatar` (str): avatar of author of quoted tweet
  - `quote_author_name` (str): name of author of quoted tweet
  - `quote_author_tag` (str): twitter username/handle of author of quoted tweet
  - `quote_text` (str): text of quoted tweet

- Returns:
  - image: Twitter image in PIL Image format


You can get access to the function on this repository. The logic of the function is to split the tweet in many parts, and combine their positions at the end. These components can all be rotated in a conjoint experiment. 

## CreateTweet

A simple example using the CreateTweet. 

```{python}
from conjoint_tweets import *
tweet = CreateTweet()
SaveTweet(tweet, "output/tweet.png", quality = 95)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/tweet.png")
```
```

```

## QuoteTweet

To generate a quote tweet, you just need to add quote=true

```{python}
qt = CreateTweet(quote=True)
SaveTweet(qt, "output/qttweet.png", quality = 95)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/qttweet.png")
```


## Another Example

Now let's see an example with inputs we provide to the function

```{python}
img = CreateTweet(
    author_avatar="input/avatar/woman_clean.png",
    author_name="Daydream Whale",
    author_tag="@DaydreamWhale",
    text="Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front; And now, instead of mounting barded steeds. To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber. To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.",
    reactions_retweet="100",
    reactions_quote="200",
    reactions_like="20K",
    time="2022-07-05 14:34",
    quote=True,
    quote_author_avatar="input/avatar/woman_clean.png",
    quote_author_name="Mobsteroid",
    quote_author_tag="@mobsteroid",
    quote_text="Now is the winter of our discontent. Made glorious summer by this sun of York; And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house. In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths. Our bruised arms hung up for monuments. Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, Our dreadful marches to delightful measures."
)
img.save('output/tweet_quote.png', quality=95)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/tweet_quote.png")
```

## Rotating to generate the conjoints

The final step is just to write a nested loop to iterate over several parameters


```{python, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
empty_background= ["empty_tweet.png"]
avatars = ["woman_clean.png", "woman2_clean.png", "woman3_clean.png"]
names = ["Tiago", "Katie", "KC", "Katie"]
tags = ["@Tiago", "@Katie", "@KC", "@Katie"]
texts = ["This is just a long and random tweet to test the code to generate conjoints tweets on the fly. This is gonna be great! It looks better longer the text is", 
"This is just a SECOND long and random tweet to test the code to generate conjoints tweets on the fly. This is gonna be great! It looks better longer the text is"]
reactions = [["100","300", "20k"],["    1", "     5", "     6"]]


for a, back in enumerate(empty_background):
  for b, avatar in enumerate(avatars):
    for c, name in enumerate(names):
      for d, tag in enumerate(tags):
        for e, text in enumerate(texts):
          for f, reaction in enumerate(reactions):
            # create name to save
            output= "a_" + str(a) + "_" + "b_" + str(b) + "_" + "c_" + str(c) + "_" + "d_" + \
            str(d) + "_" + "e_" + str(e) + "_" + "f_" + str(f)
            output_to_save = "output/" + str(output) + ".png"
            #gen the tweet
            create_tweet(empty_background=back, 
                         avatar=avatar, 
                         name=name, 
                         tag=tag, 
                         text=text, 
                         reactions=reaction, 
                         output=output_to_save)                         
            
```

<!-- See an example below -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("output/a_0_b_2_c_0_d_3_e_0_f_1.png")
mean(c(82, 85, 76, 78, 78, 77, 75))

```

<!-- Done! From here you just need to upload those in your survey and run the experiments. In future iterations of this code, I hope to show how to easily connect these images with Qualtrics -->
